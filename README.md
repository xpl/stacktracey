Parses call stacks. Reads sources. Clean & filtered output. Sourcemaps. Node & browsers.

## Why

- [x] Simple
- [x] Works in Node and browsers, \*nix and Windows
- [x] Allows hiding library calls / ad-hoc exclusion (via `// @hide` marker)
- [x] Provides source text for call locations
- [x] Fetches sources synchronously (even in browsers) via [get-source](https://github.com/xpl/get-source)
- [x] Full sourcemap support
- [x] Extracts useful information from `SyntaxError` instances
- [x] [Pretty printing](https://github.com/xpl/stacktracey/#pretty-printing)

## What For

- [Error overlay UIs](https://github.com/xpl/panic-overlay/#how-it-looks) for easier front-end development
- [Better error reporting](https://github.com/xpl/ololog#pretty-printing-error-instances) for Node projects
- [Advanced logging](https://github.com/xpl/ololog#displaying-call-location) (displaying call locations)
- Assertion printing

## How To

```bash
npm install stacktracey
```

```javascript
import StackTracey from 'stacktracey'
```

Captures the current call stack:

```javascript
stack = new StackTracey ()            // captures the current call stack
```

Parses stacks from an `Error` object:

```javascript
stack = new StackTracey (error)
stack = new StackTracey (error.stack) // ...or from raw string
```

Stores parsed data in `.items`:

```javascript
stack.items.length // num entries
stack.items[0]     // top
```

...where each item exposes:

```javascript
{
    beforeParse:  <original text>,
    callee:       <function name>,
    calleeShort:  <shortened function name>,
    file:         <full path to file>,       // e.g. /Users/john/my_project/node_modules/foobar/main.js
    fileRelative: <relative path to file>,   // e.g. node_modules/foobar/main.js
    fileShort:    <short path to file>,      // e.g. foobar/main.js
    fileName:     <file name>,               // e.g. main.js
    line:         <line number>,             // starts from 1
    column:       <column number>,           // starts from 1

    index:          /* true if occured in HTML file at index page    */,
    native:         /* true if occured in native browser code        */,
    thirdParty:     /* true if occured in library code               */,
    hide:           /* true if marked as hidden by "// @hide" tag    */,
    syntaxError:    /* true if generated from a SyntaxError instance */
}
```

Accessing sources:

```javascript
stack = stack.withSources () // returns a copy of stack with all items supplied with sources
top   = stack.items[0]       // top item
```

...or:

```javascript
top = stack.withSourceAt (0) // supplies source for an individiual item (by index)
```

...or:

```javascript
top = stack.withSource (stack.items[0]) // supplies source for an individiual item
```

The returned items contain the following additional fields (already mapped through sourcemaps):

```javascript
{
    ... // all the previously described fields

    line:       <original line number>,
    column:     <original column number>,
    sourceFile: <original source file object>,
    sourceLine: <original source line text>
}
```

To learn about the `sourceFile` object, read the [get-source](https://github.com/xpl/get-source#get-source) docs.

## Cleaning Output

```javascript
stack = stack.clean ()
```

It does the following:

1. Reads sources (if available)
2. Excludes locations marked with the `isThirdParty` flag (library calls)
3. Excludes locations marked with a `// @hide` comment (user defined exclusion)
4. Merges repeated lines (via the `.mergeRepeatedLines`)

## Custom `isThirdParty` Predicate

You can override the `isThirdParty` behavior by subclassing `StackTracey`:

```
class MyStackTracey extends StackTracey {

    isThirdParty (path) {
        return (super.isThirdParty (path)    // include default behavior
                || path.includes ('my-lib')) // paths including 'my-lib' will be marked as thirdParty
                && !path.includes ('jquery') // jquery paths won't be marked as thirdParty
    }
}

...

const stack = new MyStackTracey (error).withSources ()
```

## Pretty Printing

```javascript
const prettyPrintedString = new StackTracey (error).asTable ()
```

...or (for pretty printing cleaned output):

```javascript
const prettyPrintedString = new StackTracey (error).clean ().asTable ()
```

It produces a nice compact table layout (thanks to [`as-table`](https://github.com/xpl/as-table)), supplied with source lines (if available):

```
at shouldBeVisibleInStackTrace     test.js:25                 const shouldBeVisibleInStackTrace = () => new StackTracey ()
at it                              test.js:100                const stack = shouldBeVisibleInStackTrace ()                
at callFn                          mocha/lib/runnable.js:326  var result = fn.call(ctx);                                  
at run                             mocha/lib/runnable.js:319  callFn(this.fn);                                            
at runTest                         mocha/lib/runner.js:422    test.run(fn);                                               
at                                 mocha/lib/runner.js:528    self.runTest(function(err) {                                
at next                            mocha/lib/runner.js:342    return fn();                                                
at                                 mocha/lib/runner.js:352    next(suites.pop());                                         
at next                            mocha/lib/runner.js:284    return fn();                                                
at <anonymous>                     mocha/lib/runner.js:320    next(0);                  
```

If you find your pretty printed tables undesirably trimmed (or maybe too long to fit in the line), you can provide custom column widths when calling `asTable` (...or, alternatively, by overriding `maxColumnWidths ()` method):

```javascript
stack.asTable ({
    callee:     30,
    file:       60,
    sourceLine: 80
})
```

## Using As Custom Exception Printer In Node

You can even replace the default NodeJS exception printer with this! This is how you can do it:

```javascript
process.on ('uncaughtException',  e => { /* print the stack here */ })
process.on ('unhandledRejection', e => { /* print the stack here */ })
```

But the most simple way to achieve that is to use the [`ololog`](https://github.com/xpl/ololog/blob/master/README.md) library (that is built upon StackTracey and several other handy libraries coded by me). Check it out, [it's pretty awesome and will blow your brains out](https://github.com/xpl/ololog/blob/master/README.md) :)

```javascript
const log = require ('ololog').handleNodeErrors ()

// you can also print Errors by simply passing them to the log() function
```

## Parsing `SyntaxError` instances

For example, when trying to `require` a file named `test_files/syntax_error.js`:

```javascript
// next line contains a syntax error (not a valid JavaScript)
foo->bar ()
```

...the pretty printed call stack for the error thrown would be something like:

```
at (syntax error)                  test_files/syntax_error.js:2  foo->bar ()
at it                              test.js:184                   try { require ('./test_files/syntax_error.js') }
at runCallback                     timers.js:781
at tryOnImmediate                  timers.js:743
at processImmediate [as _immediat  timers.js:714
```

...where the first line is generated from parsing the raw output from the `util.inspect` call in Node. Unfortunately, this won't work in older versions of Node (v4 and below) as these versions can't provide any meaningful information for a `SyntaxError` instance.

## Array Methods

All StackTracey instances expose `map`, `filter`, `concat` and `slice` methods. These methods will return mapped, filtered, joined, reversed and sliced `StackTracey` instances, respectively:

```javascript
s = new StackTracey ().slice (1).filter (x => !x.thirdParty) // current stack shifted by 1 and cleaned from library calls

s instanceof StackTracey // true
```

## Extra Stuff

You can compare two locations via this predicate (tests `file`, `line` and `column` for equality):

```javascript
StackTracey.locationsEqual (a, b)
```

To force-reload the sources, you can invalidate the global source cache (calls `getSource.resetCache ()` from [get-source](https://github.com/xpl/get-source)):

```javascript
StackTracey.resetCache ()
```
